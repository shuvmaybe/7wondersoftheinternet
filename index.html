                <p class="question">Q: Why won't my code work?</p>
                <p class="answer">A: Oh, great question. It won't work because you havenâ€™t provided any code. It's like asking why your car wonâ€™t start when you havenâ€™t even turned the key.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

            <div class="qa-content">
                <p class="question">Q: It doesn't work, I get an error.</p>
                <p class="answer">A: Fantastic! An error message! Too bad you didn't think to actually include it. Itâ€™s like going to the doctor and saying, "Iâ€™m sick," but never mentioning where it hurts.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="qa-section" id="question3">

            <div class="qa-content">
                <p class="question">Q: Can someone help me with this thing that is completely unrelated to the place I'm asking it in?</p>
                <p class="answer">A: Asking for help about something irrelevant in a specialized chatroom is like walking into a bakery and asking for car repair. Go where it actually makes sense.</p>

                <p class="question">Q: Will this work? <em>[code]</em></p>
                <p class="answer">A: Maybe try it and see. âœ¨</p>
            </div>

            <div class="qa-content">
                <p class="question">Q: My app crashed. Help?</p>
                <p class="answer">A: "My app crashed" with zero context is the equivalent of saying "My pc doesn't boot" and not mentioning anything else. What were you doing? Any error messages? Start being useful if you want help.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

                <p class="question">Q: Can you make this for me? <em>[to someone clearly inexperienced in the field]</em></p>
                <p class="answer">A: Asking someone with zero experience to build something complex is like asking a kid to solve a Rubik's Cube blindfolded. It's not going to happen.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

            <div class="qa-content">
                <p class="question">Q: Can you create this extremely complicated thing for free?</p>
                <p class="answer">A: Sure, let me just pull out my magic wand! Seriously though, asking for something intricate for free is absurd and delusional. And if you expect someone to create anythingâ€”simple or complexâ€”without lifting a finger yourself, you're living in a fantasy. Get real.</p>
